# FRL
Frequency Recording Library

Required!!!

You will need to manually get the library for pyaudio!
You can find multiple versions here: https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyaudio
Look for the .whl file specific to your version of Python and OS

You will also need to download VLC(https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html) and ffmpeg(https://www.ffmpeg.org/)

Once these are downloaded and installed, you will have to update your Path Environment Variable for the locations of
these two items. For instance:

C:\Program Files\VideoLAN\VLC
C:\Program Files\ffmpeg\bin

Once all of this has been complete, you should be able to run the application.
